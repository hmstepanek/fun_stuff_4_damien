# fun_stuff_4_damien
fun mini projects for Damien to learn to code in python

Task 1:
    Make a Word class that checks if a word is a palindrome. See Word.py for more details.

Task 2:
    Make Word class maintain the case of a word when it reverses it. So
    Damien reverses to Neimad instead of neimaD.

Task 3:
    Make a new file called Geometry.py. It will request from a user the type of shape and the
    demensions of the shape.

    Make a new class inside Geometry.py called Rectangle. Rectangle will have attributes
    length and height. An attribute is a characteristic of a class. For example in the Word
    class it had the property self._word.

    Next add a method called area. This will return the area of the Rectangle. Print this
    value to the screen in the __main__.

    Try adding a more complicated shape like a triangle or a trapizoid. (Maybe you can use this
    to cheat a little bit in Geometry class.)
